FileHistory.exe is a legitimate system process associated with Microsoft's Windows operating system, specifically version 10.0.15063.0, and is part of the File History feature that allows users to back up their files and restore previous versions of documents. As a Microsoft-published file, it is generally considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware; however, users may occasionally encounter errors related to the application, such as issues with accessing backup drives or problems in restoring files, which can often be resolved through troubleshooting steps or by adjusting settings within the File History interface. It is important for users to ensure that they are running the official version of the software to avoid any security risks associated with counterfeit files that may masquerade as FileHistory.exe, as malware can sometimes disguise itself using similar names.
